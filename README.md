# ALXprodev-advanced_git

## Overview

This repository is designed to demonstrate and practice **GitFlow**, a popular Git branching model used to manage complex development workflows. It covers the basics of GitFlow setup, feature branching, release management, and automation via Git hooks.

GitFlow introduces a standardized way of organizing branches to enable parallel development, smooth release processes, and easier maintenance of production code.

## Project Objectives

- **Learn and implement GitFlow branching model** with default configurations to understand its core concepts and workflow.
- **Create and manage feature branches** to isolate new work from stable code.
- **Create and manage release branches** for preparing production-ready versions.
- **Use Git hooks** to automate checks and logging during development, improving code quality and process transparency.
- **Practice merging strategies** to handle integration of features and releases while resolving conflicts.
- **Use tagging** to mark releases for easy identification and rollback if necessary.

## Key Concepts

### GitFlow Workflow

- **Main Branch (`main`)**: Contains production-ready, stable code.
- **Development Branch (`develop`)**: Integration branch where features are merged.
- **Feature Branches (`feature/*`)**: Used to develop new features; branched off from `develop`.
- **Release Branches (`release/*`)**: Used to finalize a new production release; branched off from `develop`.
- **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)**: Used for quick fixes on production code; branched off from `main`.

### Branching and Merging

- Features are developed in isolation and merged back into `develop` when complete.
- Releases are prepared in dedicated branches, allowing testing and fixes before merging into `main`.
- Tags are used to mark release points in the repository history.
- Proper merging and conflict resolution ensure smooth collaboration.

### Git Hooks

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automate validation before commits are accepted (e.g., ensuring every directory contains documentation).
- **Post-merge hooks**: Automate actions after merges (e.g., logging merges into production).

## Technologies & Tools

- **Git**: Distributed version control system.
- **GitFlow**: A branching model for Git, with supporting extensions and commands.
- **Git Hooks**: Scripts that run automatically at different points in the Git lifecycle.
- **GitHub**: Remote repository hosting and collaboration platform.

---

## Repository Structure

- **Root directory**: Contains general project documentation (`README.md`) and configuration files.
- **Feature directories**: Separate folders (e.g., `login-page/`, `signup-page/`) to hold feature-specific code and documentation.
- **Git hooks directory**: `.git/hooks` contains custom scripts for automating workflows.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow GitFlow conventions to create branches for features and releases.
3. Make changes, commit, and push to the corresponding branches.
4. Use GitFlow commands to start and finish features and releases.
5. Utilize Git hooks to ensure commit quality and maintain logs.
6. Inspect tags for released versions.
